# munki-rebrand

Scripts used by University of Oxford IT Services to rebrand [Munki](https://github.com/munki) for their *Orchard* branded Mac management solution.

This repo can give you some idea of how we rebrand munki at University of Oxford to bring it under our *Orchard* brand, add preflight and postflight scrips for managedsoftwareupdate, and a postflight for the installer package. Most of the scripts will need rework to be of use to others, as will the .icns file and artwork - please do not use our *Orchard* brand. 

We originally used the [munki_rebrand.py script](https://gist.github.com/bochoven/c1c656e0c2e1b1078dfd) by [Arjen van Bochoven](https://github.com/bochoven) to inject the pre/posflight scripts for munki into the munkitools mpkg itself, but now package these separately and push them out with munkitools so they are more easily updated separately from the installer.
